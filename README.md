### an I/O project to mimic the [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) command line tool which is built in **Rust**.

Rustâ€™s *speed*, *safety*, *single binary output*, and *cross-platform support* make it an ideal language for creating command line tools, so for this project, Iâ€™ll make my own version of the classic command line search tool `grep` (**g**lobally search a **r**egular **e**xpression and **p**rint).
